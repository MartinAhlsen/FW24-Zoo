<!-- Instructions
Your task is to build the Australia Zoo activity as a multi page React website.

Your knowledge of project design, state, props, components and routing are being examined. The design is somewhat up to you, but the structure of the pages is detailed below.:

The local djurpark is hosting an exhibition of Australian animals and want to raise awareness by publishing a website.​
The website will consist of:​ -->
<!-- a home page​ -->
<!-- a page detailing the mammals​ -->
<!-- a page details the birds​ -->
<!-- a page detailing the reptiles -->
<!-- Attached are 3 files detailing 9 animals. Add more if you like, but your site MUST use these 9 animals. -->

<!-- Page Structure: -->
<!-- Each page should have a header with a logo​ -->
<!-- Each page should have a navigational menu with links to “home”, "birds", "mammals" and "reptiles". ​ -->
<!-- Each page should have a footer with some content.​ -->
<!-- Each page should have a side bar and a main content area – the content of both of these areas will be different for each page, but the page layouts should be similar -->
-Home Page
-Sidebar​:
<!-- Shows a list with the names of all the animals​ -->
-Main content:​
<!-- On page load shows a welcome message​ -->
When an animal name in the sidebar is clicked, the welcome message is replaced with a short summary of that animal​
A “Read More” button is displayed after the short summary, clicking it leads to the “animal detail” page​
        Readmore should be 
If the “active” animal's name is clicked again, it is no longer active, and the “welcome” message is displayed
Only one animal can be active at a time

short summary of an animal consists of:​
a small image of the animal​
<!-- the name of the animal​ -->
<!-- the first 200 characters of the description (or a similar solution)​ -->
what the animal eats​
which group it belongs to WITH a link to the group page (eg mammal, bird or reptile)

Clicking on Read More button for any animal on the home page should detail that animal:​
Show the full summary of the animal styles as a pop up or somesuch​
Show a “Back to Home” button


-Group Pages
-Sidebar​
<!-- show the animal names that are in the group ONLY. You should NOT have birds on the reptile page​ -->
-Main content:​
<!-- Show a message about that group type  -->
When an animal name is clicked show the full summary of the animal
The full summary should show all the properties of an animal. How you choose to display the information is up to you, but all of it must be shown.

<!-- Note: it is possible to build this as a true SPA with NO routes, but you MUST use routing in this assignment -->

To achieve a Godkänt grade you must:
<!-- Routes for 4 pages using React router -->
<!-- Reusable components -->
<!-- Relevant use of props -->
<!-- Relevant use of useState -->
<!-- Components organised correctly -->
Responsive design.

<!-- To achieve a Välgodkänt grade you must complete the above and: -->
<!-- External data imported where needed -->
<!-- Directory and file organisation -->
<!-- Use of CSS modules -->
<!-- Use of useEffect if appropriate -->
<!-- Use of Layout for page structure -->
<!-- Correct code style and syntax -->
<!-- Semantic naming -->

Submission: 
A link to the live site published on Render, Vercel or other service (github pages will NOT support React)
